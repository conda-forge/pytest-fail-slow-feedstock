  summary: Fail tests that take too long to run
  description: |
    `pytest-fail-slow` is a pytest plugin for treating tests as failed if they
    took too long to run.  It adds markers for failing tests if they or their
    setup stages run for longer than a given duration, along with command-line
    options for applying the same cutoff to all tests.
